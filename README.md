# Merge-sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits an array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It ensures stable, efficient sorting with a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases. Ideal for large datasets due to its predictable performance.
